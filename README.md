### Summary

The goal of this project was to practice responsive design through CSS flexbox.Â I gave my article listings fixed height and width, and made their container `div` a flexbox container. By styling the container with `flex-wrap: wrap`, I was able to display different numbers of articles per page as the browser is resized.

### Project Goals

- [x] Create an article listing that adjusts how many articles fit on a page
      based on the size of the screen
- [x] Utilize CSS flexbox

### Technologies Used

HTML, CSS
